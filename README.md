# Gerdemann.GoogleIndex

This package provides a backend module that can be used to trigger
the indexing of pages at Google or to remove pages from the Google index.

**Attention!** Currently, Google officially supports only special page types (e.g. job pages).
Unofficially, however, you can send all pages to Google.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require gerdemann/googleindex
```

The package will register itself automatically.

## Usage

Go to the backend module "Google Index". There you can send the page to Google or remove it from Google.
